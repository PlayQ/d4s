# Setup

We've already mentioned that `d4s` is powered by `Izumi`. In fact, `d4s` is the first library in Izumi's <br/>
ecosystem, thus `d4s` heavily relies on it. Further, we'll talk discover Izumi's components that allows `d4s` <br/>
to archive excellence.

Now, let's talk about the preparation we need to do in order to get working. There are many ways to handle dependencies,
her we will cover two variants: with DI or without DI. `PlayQ`'s team recommends to use DiStage as a dependency injection <br/>
framework that handles all dependencies for you and even more. Important note: in case you don't like DI or don't want to use it <br/>
you can [go ahead and look](#managing-dependencies-manually) what dependencies you need to have to start work with DynamoDB.

## Managing dependencies manually :construction_worker: :hammer_and_wrench:
